Couch::Couchbase is a Perl client for Couchbase (http://www.couchbase.org).

This is a 'smart' or 'Type-2' client, as opposed to legacy Memcached clients.

This module depends on having libcouchbase development packages installed;

It currently features no functionality unit tests.

Included is a wrapper module which provides backwards API compatibility
with Cache::Memcached::* modules.

Currently only the single-op synchronous inteface is implemented.
